Raviolist is a collaborative project about presenting the move lists of all the characters from as many fighting games as possible. It's a tool created for the FGC.

Raviolist is a web app, you can add it to your mobile device home screen and it will act like a native application would. It requires no permission and will always stay up-to-date. Great!

## Contribute

Raviolist is a collaborative project and everyone is welcome to take part in its development.

For example, this is the [data file for Poison from Ultra Street Fighter 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukafaxx/raviolist/gh-pages/_data/usf4/poison.yml) (here at Raviolist, we like Poison). Data files are easy to read, easy to write, and the most important thing one can submit to the project right now. It doesn't matter how you send them, if it's only one file or a complete game set, I will gladly accept the data and after reviewing it, push everything online as soon as I can.

Now, you know that you can participate even if your only tool is a notepad!  

On the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/lukafaxx/raviolist), you will be able to understand how everything works, from inputs terminology to folders hierarchy, and see every single change that has happened to Raviolist since its launch on December 1st, 2014. Even fixing a typo or changing the monetization formula will appear on GitHub as a commit, transparency is total.

Also on GitHub, you might want to open a new [issue](https://github.com/lukafaxx/raviolist/issues) to ask any question, signal any error or request any feature. A GitHub account would be required but this is the best way to communicate any concern about this project.

And if you are quite techsavvy, you can fork the original repository and even build the entire site on your computer to test your new pages before submitting them for a merge. Here is a [list of people who are quite techsavvy](https://github.com/lukafaxx/raviolist/network/members). :)

I'm always available [@lukafaxx](https://twitter.com/lukafaxx), let's have a chat! Building my Twitter network is important because this is how I might find more and more awesome contributors.

Finally, you can contribute simply by telling your friends what you think of Raviolist!
