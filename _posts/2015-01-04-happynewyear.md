title: Happy New Year!
---

It's 2015, we made it!

I was busy not pushing any commit to the repository for the last few days but I am back. I recently bought a new computer, installed everything I need to work with GitHub and Raviolist, and I now intend for the Guilty Gear Xrd move lists to be completed as quickly as possible.

I still haven't played this game on PS4 yet (as I don't own one) so it's difficult for me to make sure everything I write is correct. The good thing is, there's an official Japanese website so I can just gather the data from [there](http://ggxrd.com/cs/character.html) and try my best with the translation of moves names. Hmm, as I'm writing this, I can see that three new characters have been added since my previous GGXrd related commit. I'll add them to our roster right now!

Hopefully, GGXrd will one day come to PC. I can't speak much about the gameplay but it's a gorgeous video game that makes such a good use of cel shaded graphics. I don't think we've seen a single Arc System Works title on PC since BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger though, and that was in 2010. A happy year, that one. :(
