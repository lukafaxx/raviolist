title: Input visualization
---

Reading is tough... But the images for improved input visualization are finally here!

Although some motions currently have temporary solutions, it already helps a lot to understand the required inputs for each move. The whole terminology for the Raviolist data files had to change but thanks to [Atom](https://atom.io/)'s regex mode for batch processing, the task was kinda fun. I had to choose which text strings to replace in which order so I would merely click the 'Replace all' button and not have to edit a single input value manually. 'Twas like a puzzle. Anyway, data files are less literal now but much faster to write for everyone. The [Poison example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukafaxx/raviolist/gh-pages/_data/usf4/poison.yml) from the About Raviolist page is still up.

Visually, I decided to make use of spacing to differentiate circular motions from other ones (e.g. qcf from dpf) but once again, I'll probably use more appropriate images in the future. Charged directions have a different color which I hope is explicit enough. All different punches and kicks buttons aren't actually image files, I styled them with the CSS.

This is a feature Raviolist needed to prove itself accessible and I'm glad that I will now be able to spend more time gathering data.

That is, after the Capcom Cup 2014 which is about to start.
